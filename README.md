# Milo

This is a linter for HTML written in Go. The goal is to provide a single binary that can lint HTML in the context of a CI server without installing other tools.

## Initial Considerations

- Milo considers html partials and validates the rules that apply to these.
- Milo considers erb and plush as part of the HTML and works around these.
- Milo will start simple and write its output only to be compatible with github, maybe later we add/other formats.
- Milo will start by enforcing all the rules in the catalog.

## Installation

You can pull Milo's binary from Github's [releases](https://github.com/wawandco/milo/releases) folder:

#### MacOS
```sh
$ curl -OL https://github.com/wawandco/milo/releases/latest/download/milo_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf milo_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
$ sudo mv milo /usr/local/bin/milo
# or if you have ~/bin folder setup in the environment PATH variable
$ mv milo ~/bin/milo
```

#### Linux
```sh
$ wget https://github.com/wawandco/milo/releases/latest/download/milo_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf milo_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
