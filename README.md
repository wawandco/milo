# Milo

This is a linter for HTML written in Go. The goal is to provide a single binary that can lint HTML in the context of a CI server without installing other tools.

## Initial Considerations

- Milo considers html partials and validates the rules that apply to these.
- Milo considers erb and plush as part of the HTML and works around these.
- Milo will start simple and write its output only to be compatible with github, maybe later we add/other formats.

## Installation

We recommend using [gobinaries.com](gobinaries.com) to get Milo.

```sh
curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/wawandco/milo | sh
```

You can also download Milo binaries from our releases folder.

## Usage

```
milo [folder or file]
```

Example:

```
milo templates
milo templates/file.html
```

### Configuration

Referees to run can get configured by creating a file named `.milo.yml` in the root of the folder to analize. An example of the .milo.yml file that can be used as a starting point is:

```
output: github # TODO!
reviewers:
  - doctype/present 
```

If Milo does not find this file in your folder it will run All the linters, the same if the reviewers list is empty.
