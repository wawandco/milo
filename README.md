# Milo

This is a linter for HTML written in Go. The goal is to provide a single binary that can review HTML in the context of a CI server without installing other tools.

## Initial Considerations

- Milo considers html partials and validates the rules that apply to these.
- Milo considers erb and plush as part of the HTML and works around these.

## Installation

We recommend using [gobinaries.com](gobinaries.com) to get Milo.

```sh
curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/wawandco/milo/cmd/milo | sh
```

You can also download Milo binaries from our releases folder.

## Usage

```
milo review [folder or file]
```

Example:

```
milo review templates
milo review templates/file.html
```

### Configuration

Once you have installed Milo you can run 
```
milo init
```

And it will generate a `.milo.yml` file that looks something like:

```
output: github # could be `github` or `silent`
reviewers:
  - doctype/present 
  - ...
```

This file will be used by the Milo binary to determine which reviewers to run our files against.
